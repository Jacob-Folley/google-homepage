From The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)


For this project, I am going to build the Google Homepage from scratch. First I will log all this into my github to keep track. I am still not 100% comfortable with git, but feel as though I can improve fast. Then I will use basic html to structure the page with things such as a form. Then I will style it to look like the actually google homepage with basic CSS.
